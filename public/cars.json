	"name": "Fiat 1500",
	"info": "The 1961 Fiat 1300 and 1500 saloon was a sharp-suited range of saloons, which consolidated their maker's position as Italy's favourite car manufacturer. They were well engineered and drove well, setting high dynamic standards. They were offered in saloon and estate forms, but it was the Cabriolet that caught the imaginations of buyers in export markets. Styling was by Pininfarina, which explains their passing resemblance to the Ferrari 275GTS, only smaller, and much cheaper. It carried over the saloon's well-engineered underpinnings - but also had a five-speed gearbox and disc brakes.",

	"name": "Fiat 600",
	"info": "With the Nuova 500, Fiat proved that it could build a genuinely fun small car that people wanted – and when it came to producing a larger brother to it, the company used the same ingredients to achieve pretty much the same result. The 600 had a monocoque body with two B-pillar hinged 'suicide' doors, which opened backwards and seated four. It was powered by a 633cc 29bhp water-cooled four-cylinder engine, which sat behind the rear wheels. This layout was excellent for space efficiency if not ultimate handling, despite independent suspension.",

	"name": "Nash Ambassador Airflyte",
	"info": "There has always been a touch of controversy about the 1949-1951 Nash Airflyte. Critics have decried their near cartoon-like styling, while supporters have praised them for their comfort, room, and quiet. Although many U.S. automakers went bankrupt during the Great Depression, some of them managed to survive and even flourish prior to and after World War II. One such manufacturer was Nash, who survived the Great Depression thanks to its \"Give the customer more than he has paid for\" slogan, along with a host of innovations that included a straight-eight engine with overhead valves, twin spark plugs, synchromesh transmissions, and automatic centralized chassis lubrication.",

	"name": "Humber Hawk Series IV",
	"info": "The 1957 Humber Hawk was a very different car to the one that it replaced. It was underpinned by a new unitary construction stucture, and was now clearly a product of the late-1950s, and not one based on a pre-war car. It was claimed to be the largest bodyshell being built in the UK at the time, and it certainly was big compared with the opposition. It was powered by a 2267cc overhead valve engine from the previous generation of Hawk, giving 83mph from its 73bhp. Series II cars had disc brakes, but the biggest change to the family came with the Series IV of 1964, when the cabin changed to a sleeker profile with more glass, echoing the changes made to the Hillman Super Minx Series III.",

	"info": "The Tatra T97 was introduced in 1936 and remained in production until 1939, with 508 examples produced. It was equipped with a 1.8-liter flat four-cylinder unit offering 40 horsepower. The T97 was offered as a cheaper alternative to the T77A and T87 and lacked some amenities of the more expensive model. For instance the T97 lacked the wrap-around window design and instead used a flat pane. It also lacked quarter windows for the rear passengers. ",

	"name": "Ford Pilot V8",
  "info": "The Pilot sold reasonably well for a car of its type at the time – just over 22,000 in four years, with a large number going overseas. Despite being a basically tough and durable car, very few pilots survive. The main problem was that the car aged quickly – car design moved on rapidly from the early 1950s, and the Pilot quickly became regarded as old and thirsty. Many went around the time of the 1956 Suez Crisis. Though only five years out of production, they were pretty-much worthless, though from the early 1960s they did become slightly sought-after for the newly-emerging sport of ‘stock car’ racing.",

	"name": "Citroën Traction Avant 11",
	"info": "The car was launched in April 1934, and although Citroën christened it the 7A, it would go on to become known as the Traction Avant, thanks to its highly unusual front-wheel drive set-up. But it wasn't just this that caused the Traction Avant to make motoring history. It was also based on a welded steel monocoque (when separate chassis designs were dominant), which proved hugely strong and efficient. It was also lower than its rivals, giving it a much more modern look than the cars around it - a tradition that Citroen continues to this day. Unsurprisingly, the Traction Avant also featured advanced independent suspension all round, comprising of torsion bars and wishbones. Again, in comparison with its rivals, which mainly relied on leaf springs and live axles, this was a bold step towards modernity. In fact, the Traction Avant also ended up being the first Citroen to feature Hydropneumatic suspension - a self-levellng set-up launched in the 1954 15H model.",
